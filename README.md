UI Recreation Series – Rebuilding Real-World Interfaces with React + CSS

A series focused on rebuilding real-world UIs using React and CSS — exploring design precision, layout logic, and clean component architecture.
Where design principles meet front-end execution.


🧠 About the Series

The UI Recreation Series is a self-initiated learning and showcase project where I rebuild real-world user interfaces found on platforms like Pinterest, Dribbble, and Behance — turning static designs into functional, responsive, and reusable React components.

The goal is to:

Strengthen my understanding of UI/UX design principles through hands-on coding.

Develop pixel-perfect layouts that balance design accuracy and performance.

Build a consistent workflow between design thinking and frontend execution.

Each recreation focuses on clean code, component scalability, and attention to detail, while maintaining the aesthetic and behavior of the original design.


🧩 Tech Stack

React.js – Component-based architecture

CSS3 – Layout, styling, and responsiveness

HTML5 – Structural foundation

Vite – Lightweight bundler for development (optional)

Git + GitHub – Version control and hosting


🎨 UI Recreation #1 – Job Listing Cards

Original Design Inspiration:

A Job Listing Cards UI found on Pinterest

Key Focus Areas:

Layout grid system and spacing logic

Typography hierarchy and visual rhythm

Tag system for job types (Part-time, Full-time, etc.)

Reusable component structure

Clean hover and interactive effects

Live Preview: (Add your deployment link if you host it later)

Each project folder (like JobListingCards/) contains its own codebase, assets, and sub-README for that specific recreation.


📖 How to Run Locally :

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/samarjeets10/UI-recreation-series.git

# Navigate to project folder
cd UI-recreation-series/JobListingCards

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev


💡 Purpose of the Series :

This series isn’t just about copying UIs — it’s about understanding why they work.
Each build focuses on principles like:

Hierarchy & spacing

Visual balance

Component reusability

Accessibility and scalability

By translating design into code, the aim is to bridge the gap between design intuition and developer precision — creating UIs that are both beautiful and functional.

✨ Future Goals

Add more UI recreations (dashboards, pricing pages, landing sections)

Introduce Tailwind and Framer Motion for advanced animations

Document design principles behind each build

Possibly turn this into an open-source UI Study Hub.
